Tate & Curt Hibbs), this tool automates the process of following the book so that you don't have to type any commands or edit any files, but also modifies all examples to work with Rails 3.  All you need to do is specify the page number where you're reading and the tool will issue all commands and edit all files to bring the state of your system to an equivalent state at that page.\r\n\r\n---\r\n![Shopify - Create your own online store](http://wiki.shopify.com/upload/1/1b/Shopify-buttons-468x60.jpg \"Shopify\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/simplytech/whiches     \"Whiches\"\r\n[2]: https://github.com/simplytech/rails3-unr  \"rails3-unr\"","google":"UA-34009234-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
